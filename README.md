1.A majority of the dogs are rated between 10/10 to 15/10 however most dogs received a rating of 12/10

2.The breed with the lowest retweet and favorite count is afghan_hound with 0 rating numerator and only 16 retweets image.png

3.The ratings_numerator less than 3 seems to be not dogs which implies the algorithm for predicting the breed of the dog is not efficient

most of the ratings lie in the range 0f 10 and 15

although the numerator having a higher number than denominator is not an issue

the some values seeems to be ambiguous

the values should be replaced with the median
